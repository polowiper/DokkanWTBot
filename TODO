being able to set goals
being able to aadd in how many hours you won't be grinding 
!addTarget and they show up on your !pace !points etc
extrapolation function with a custom pace
Give us the ability to set a start time, maybe So !seed 32 would give me the seed from hour 32 

Spport the points_pace on the !highest command (I might as well support everything pepega)
