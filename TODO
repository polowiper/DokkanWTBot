!TopPaces, outputs the player who are being the fastest atm (not necesarly the top players)
being able to set goals
store the scores to make nice graphs afterwards
Gaps to the one in front (and behind too maybe ?)
being able to aadd in how many hours you won't be grinding 
 a way to estimate what time of day with their pace they'd reach whatever (Kinda did that for the wins might see that later idk)
a command to show the highest pace a person has had 
a command to show the leaderboard of the highest pace (might not do it as if I base the pace on the average then it'll just be the same as the regular leaderboard)
!addTarget and they show up on your !pace !points etc
extrapolation function with a custom pace
invert the y axis when rendering multiple people on the same graph
Give us the ability to set a start time, maybe So !seed 32 would give me the seed from hour 32
