# Ludicolo

Ludicolo is an open source discord bot that fetches data from the game Dokkan Battle and generates user data out of it

## Installation
First make sure you have [python](https://www.python.org/) installed.

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install the dependencies.

```bash
pip install -r dependencies.txt
```

## Usage
To use Ludicolo you will need to update the `BOT_TOKEN` and the `API_TOKEN` in the `config.py` file.

(Note: The api used is from [T6](https://x.com/ThievingSix) so you don't have access to it. If you want to run this bot yourself, please refer to the [dokkan-bot](https://github.com/polowiper/dokkan-bot-adapted) to fetch the data out of the game yourself.

If you have access to this api simply do
```bash
python fetch_and_save.py
```
Otherwise just use the dokkan-bot and use its `fetch.py`

Once everything is setup you will need to run.
```bash
python main.py
```
